= RELEASE HISTORY

== 1.0 / 2009-12-25

Roll is finally ready for the masses. This release overhauls
the underlying system, which is now blazing fast, supports
customizable library environments, and banashes all traces
of package management to the domain of other tools.

Changes:

* Overhauled the entire underlying system.
* Loading is now blazing fast, as is startup time.
* Metadata is now using POM meta/ standard.
* Environments provide selectable sets of available libraries.


== 0.9.4 / 2008-06-05

The .roll file is no longer used. Instead Rolls is now
using a VERSION file combined with meta/ entries for
loadpath and dependencies (ie. requires).

Changes:

* VERSION and meta/ entries are used instead of '.roll'.


== 0.9.3 / 2007-02-10

Changes:

* Change roll file format and name. It is now .roll.
* Relative require with #use should now work.


== 0.9.2 / 2007-12-17

Changes:

* Changed roll file format from ROLLRC to {name}.roll.
* The name change enabled an order of magnitude increase in startup time!


== 0.9.1 / 2007-11-27

Changes:

* Standard metadate file is now ROLLRC.
* Improved parsing of ROLLRC file, #release is now a Time object.


== 0.9.0 / 2007-11-12

Changes:

* Removed Roll namespace. Library and VersionNumber are now in toplevel.
* Fixed spelling of 'version' in Library#<=>.
* Kernel#require and load now route to Library meta-methods.
* @roll and related methods have been renamed to @package.
* Reduced scan glob to single pattern. Scanning is over 3x faster!
