= Roll

Roll is a library manager for Ruby. With Rolls developers
can run there projects in real time --no install phase
is required for one project to depend on another.

To use Roll in this way, simply navigate to the root directory
of a project. Make sure there is a "VERSION" file, formatted as: 

  name version status (date)

For example:

  xdg 0.5.0 stable (2008-10-28)

And then issue the command:

  $ roll in

And your project it READY TO ROLL!

Roll can also manage SCM repositories as means of package
distribution. For example:

  roll install xdg

This will look for an xdg repository on Rubyforge and install
the current development version of the XDG library.


== How to Install

=== Manual Installation

You will need Ruby Setup, the standalone setup.rb script, in order
top install Roll.

See: http://setup.rubyforge.org.

Once you have setup.rb, download the Roll tarball and install
it manually as follows:

  $ tar -xvzf roll-1.0.0
  $ cd roll-1.0.0
  $ sudo setup.rb all

On Windows, this last line needs to be 'ruby setup.rb all'.

=== RubyGems Installation

We strongly recommend installing Rolls manually b/c
Rolls is a peer to RubyGems. However, you can use Gems to
install it; and this is a convenient way to try it out.

  gem install roll

If you like Rolls, then later you can uninstall the gem and
install manually.
