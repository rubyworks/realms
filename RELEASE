Rolls is a Library Manager. It provides an improved require and
load system, supports versioning and metadata, and can rid
developers of the need to install packages.

This version changes the roll file (one last time!) to
.roll. The format of this file has changed. It is now a
quasi-ini or quasi-yaml file. Eg.

  name = facets
  version = 2.3.0
  status = stable
  date = 2008-02-03
  libpath = lib/core/facets;lib/more/facets

If a VERSION file is in the repo then the three middle
values will be extracted from that. Given the libpath
default is usually correct (ie. lib/#{name}), often all
this file needs to contain in the name field.

Rolls is maturing nicely. Finished adding module_require support
(does not work on C extensions btw --up to matz to add that).
Almost all necessary functionality is now in place. There is only
one major bug left due to Ruby's implementation of autoload. And
one major question --"plugin" support. Beyond that the focus
will be on refining the code over the next few releases.
