Rolls is a Library Manager. It provides an improved require and
load system, supports versioning and metadata, and can rid
developers of the need to install packages.

The .roll file is no longer used. Instead Rolls is now
using a VERSION file combined with meta/ entries for
loadpath and dependencies (ie. requires).

Rolls is maturing nicely. Almost all necessary functionality is
now in place. There is only one major issue left due to Ruby's
implementation of autoload.

Still considering how we could add plugin support.
