# TODO:
#
#   - Maybe add autopackage install system? If compresses pacakges are found in
#     a certain directory they are automatically installed?
#
#   - What about remotes? What about version tiers when remote requiring?
#
#   - Library #use should be local to the give library. This way other libraries
#     can use what they want without adding to the global require space.
#     And hopefully this help elmininate the need to rescue for backward compatability.
#
# NOTE:
#
#   - Roll's require/load doesn't work if called from within Kernel module!!!
