Rolls -- A Ruby Object-Oriented Library Ledger System

  http://roll.rubyforge.org

Rolls is a Library Manager. It provides an improved require and
load system, supports versioning and metadata, and can rid
developers of the need to install packages.

Rolls is maturing nicely. Finished adding module_require support
(does not work on C extensions btw --up to matz to add that).
Almost all necessary functionality is now in place. There is only
one major bug left due to Ruby's implementation of autoload. And
one major question --"plugin" support. Beyond that the focus
will be on refining the code over the next few releases.
