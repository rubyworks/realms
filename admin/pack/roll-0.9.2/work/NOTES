= Rolls -- Developer Notes

== Package Class

The package class is part of Box as well. For now it was
deemed best to keep a copy in each project b/c Rolls
is not intended to be installed via Gems, but Box needs
needs that option. This makes is a difficult to handle
dependencies if it is just in one or the other. The
alternative is to put the Package class in it's own
project. I'm not sure it's worth the additional effort.
It's probably easier to just make sure Roll's and Box's
Package class stay in sync --and who know their may be
good reasons for them to deverge, just as long as the
main metadata functionality stays compatible.



== Register?

  # Root location(s) of libraries.
  #
  # NOTE: This is a Rolls question.
  #
  # TODO This is an intersting idea. Instead of fixed locations in
  # the file system one could register "virtual locations" which map
  # to real locations. Worth the added flexability?
  #++
  #attr_accessor :register do
  #  @register    || { name => 'lib' }
  #end
