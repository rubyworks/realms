module Roll

  # = Package
  #
  # The name is a misonomer, since Roll's does nto deal
  # in packages, but rather SCM repositories. However,
  # until a better alternative comes forth, it suffices
  # to convey the intention of this part of Rolls. Ie.
  # It serves in place of a traditional package manager.OB
