= List Command

To see a list of available projects use the `list` command.

  `roll list`

The standard output will look like:

  foo      ruby     tryme

Notice the entry for ruby. You won't find this project in our temporary
projects location. It is a built-in "project" that represents Ruby's
standard library.
