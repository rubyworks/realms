# Remove Command

The `remove` command can be used to remove locations from the load cache.

    `realm rm projects`

Since `projects` was the only lookup location in the load cache,
now that it has been removed we can see that there are no entries
in the cache any longer.

    ledger = Dir['cache/ruby/*.ledger'].first
    json = File.read(ledger).strip
    json.assert == "{}"

When using the `rm` command, if no directory is given then the current
working directory is assumed.
